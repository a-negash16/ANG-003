# An Enhanced Comparative Analysis of POS Taggers: CLAWS, NLTK, and Stanford

Purpose:
This repository contains a Python program developed for a project in a Text Analysis (CS 401) course. The purpose of the project was is to identify and analyze discrepancies in the POS tagging outputs from the CLAWS, NLTK, and Stanford taggers. 

Methodology
The Python program is designed to parse the outputs of the three taggers, coupling words with their respective tags and organizing them in a List of Lists (LoL) data structure.

Key Features
Discrepancy Analysis: Focuses on identifying instances where the same word receives different tags from the taggers.
Tokenization Handling: Addresses challenges arising from different tokenization approaches by the taggers.
Output Categorization: Outputs are categorized into tag discrepancies, tag matches, and tokenization issues, enhancing the clarity of the analysis.

Limitations and Future Work
A comprehensive solution addressing all limitations has not been fully realized.

Usage and Contribution
The program is intended for linguistic researchers, students, or enthusiasts interested in POS tagging and natural language processing. Users can apply this tool to analyze and compare POS tagging outputs from different taggers, offering insights into their respective methodologies and limitations.
